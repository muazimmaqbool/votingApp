-> Voting Application (backend only):

1-> About Project:
        What we want is that 'A functionality where users can give vote to the given set of candidates'
        We want these thins: Modal and Route

2-> Functionality:
        1. User sigin and signup
        2. See the list of candidates
        3. Vote one of the candidates, after Voting user can't vote again.
        4. Ther should be a route which shows the list of candidates and their live  vote counts sorted by their vote count
        5. User data must contain their one unique goverment id proof (example: aadhar card number)
        6. There should be one admin who can only maintain the table of candidates and he can't be able to vote at all.
        7. Users can change their password
        8. Users can login only with their aadhar card number and password
        9. Admin is not able to vote

3-> Routes (APIs):
     To implement above functionalities we need these routes:

                /signup: POST - Create a new user account.
                /login: POST - Log in to an existing account. [ aadhar card number + password ]

     2) Voting:

                /vote/:candidateId: POST - Vote for a specific candidate.

     3) Vote Counts:
                /vote/counts: GET - Get the list of candidates sorted by their vote counts.

        3)Installed mongoose
        4)Created Models folder and added different models in it:
